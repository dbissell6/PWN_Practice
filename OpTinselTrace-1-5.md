## Sherlock Scenario

An elf named "Elfin" has been acting rather suspiciously lately. He's been working at odd hours and seems to be bypassing some of Santa's security protocols. Santa's network of intelligence elves has told Santa that the Grinch got a little bit too tipsy on egg nog and made mention of an insider elf! Santa is very busy with his naughty and nice list, so he’s put you in charge of figuring this one out. Please audit Elfin’s workstation and email communications.

## Sherlock Scenario

It seems our precious technology has been leaked to the threat actor. Our head Elf, PixelPepermint, seems to think that there were some hard-coded sensitive URLs within the technology sent. Please audit our Sparky Cloud logs and confirm if anything was stolen! PS - Santa likes his answers in UTC...

## Sherlock Scenario

Oh no! Our IT admin is a bit of a cotton-headed ninny-muggins, ByteSparkle left his VPN configuration file in our fancy private S3 location! The nasty attackers may have gained access to our internal network. We think they compromised one of our TinkerTech workstations. Our security team has managed to grab you a memory dump - please analyse it and answer the questions! Santa is waiting…

## Sherlock Scenario

Printers are important in Santa’s workshops, but we haven’t really tried to secure them! The Grinch and his team of elite hackers may try and use this against us! Please investigate using the packet capture provided! The printer server IP Address is 192.168.68.128

## Sherlock Scenario

You'll notice a lot of our critical server infrastructure was recently transferred from the domain of our MSSP - Forela.local over to Northpole.local. We actually managed to purchase some second hand servers from the MSSP who have confirmed they are as secure as Christmas is! It seems not as we believe christmas is doomed and the attackers seemed to have the stealth of a clattering sleigh bell, or they didn’t want to hide at all!!!!!! We have found nasty notes from the Grinch on all of our TinkerTech workstations and servers! Christmas seems doomed. Please help us recover from whoever committed this naughty attack!
